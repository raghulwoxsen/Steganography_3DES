# TripleDES Encryption, Steganography, and Authentication GUI

## Overview

This Python application provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a secure user authentication system and TripleDES encryption with steganography capabilities. The program is built using the Tkinter library for the GUI, the cryptography library for TripleDES encryption, and the stegano library for steganography.

The application is divided into two main components:

1. **Authentication System:**
   - Users can sign up with a unique username and password.
   - Existing usernames are stored in a file (`usernames.txt`), and credentials are stored in another file (`credentials.txt`).
   - The signup process checks for the existence of a username before allowing registration.

2. **TripleDES Encryption and Steganography:**
   - Users can log in to access the TripleDES encryption and steganography features.
   - TripleDES encryption is used to secure a user-entered text with a randomly generated key and IV (Initialization Vector).
   - Steganography involves hiding the encrypted text within an image using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique.
   - The application allows users to encrypt and hide text in an image (`steganographic_image.png`) and reveal and decrypt the hidden text from a steganographic image.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed before running the application:

```bash
pip install cryptography stegano
```

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the Python script.

2. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python 3DES_Code.py
   ```

3. The authentication GUI will appear, providing options for signing up or logging in.

4. After successful login, the TripleDES encryption and steganography GUI will be accessible.

## File Structure

- `usernames.txt`: File storing existing usernames.
- `credentials.txt`: File storing username-password pairs.
- `steganographic_image.png`: Image file with hidden encrypted text.

## Notes

- The TripleDES key and IV are randomly generated for each encryption operation.
- Steganography is performed using the LSB technique, and the steganographic image is saved as `steganographic_image.png`.
